## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Zero-Shot Speech Recognition** by enhancing spectrograms using a novel deep learning model. The approach leverages **Style Truncation** and **Contextual Alignment Loss** to improve the quality and intelligibility of audio signals without requiring extensive labeled data. By enhancing spectrograms, the model facilitates more accurate and robust speech recognition in various applications.

## Features

- **Zero-Shot Capability**: Perform speech recognition without the need for extensive labeled datasets.
- **Spectrogram Enhancement**: Utilize deep learning techniques to optimize spectrograms for better audio quality.
- **Style Truncation**: Implement style truncation to refine the features extracted from spectrograms.
- **Contextual Alignment Loss**: Incorporate contextual alignment loss to enhance model performance based on auditory perception.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean and well-organized code structure for easy extension and maintenance.

## Code Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate different components of the project. Below is an overview of the key files related to the core functionalities:

- **Style Truncation**:
  - `spectrogram_enhancer_clip_per_pix.py`: Contains the implementation of the style truncation technique used to refine spectrogram features.

- **Contextual Alignment Loss**:
  - `spectrogram_enhancer_losses.py`: Implements the contextual alignment loss function that enhances model performance based on auditory perception.


Feel free to explore these files to understand the implementation details of the respective components.

## Model Architecture

## Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Librosa
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/liyuandagege/spectrogram_enhancer.git
    cd spectrogram_enhancer
    ```

2. **Run the Example Script**:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

    This script will load a sample audio file, perform spectrogram enhancement, and output the enhanced audio.
