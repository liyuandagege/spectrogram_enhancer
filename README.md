# spectrogram_enhancer
Design a spectrogram enhancement model to improve the quality of spectrograms for training zero-sample speech recognition models. The complete training code will be published after the formal publication of the paper
The spectrogram shown in the paper has an incorrect file name for Figure 2. I have uploaded the correct spectrogram image file, named spectrogram.pdf, to GitHub.
